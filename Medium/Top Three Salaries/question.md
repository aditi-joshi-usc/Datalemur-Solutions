# Identifying High Earners in Each Department

## Problem Statement

As part of an ongoing analysis of salary distribution within the company, your manager has requested a report identifying **high earners** in each department. A "high earner" within a department is defined as an employee with a salary **ranking among the top three salaries** (including ties) within that department.

You are to display each qualifying employee's:
- **Department name**
- **Employee name**
- **Salary**

### Additional Details & Requirements

1. **Join** the `employee` and `department` tables to retrieve department names.
2. Use a **ranking window function** so that employees with **the same salary** receive the same rank.
3. Select only the top three ranks **per department** (i.e., `rank <= 3`).
4. Sort the results by:
   1. **Department name** in ascending order,
   2. **Salary** in descending order,
   3. **Employee name** in ascending order (when thereâ€™s a tie in salary).

> **Note**: As of June 18th, the requirement for unique salaries has been removed, and we have **revised the sorting order** for the results.

### `department` Table

|-----------------|----------|--------------------------------|
| department_id   | integer  | The department ID (primary key)|

**Example Input**:

|---------------|-----------------|
| 1             | Data Analytics  |
| 2             | Data Science    |

## Desired Output

Display only those employees whose salary rank (within each department) is in the top three. Order the rows by:
1. **department_name** ASC
2. **salary** DESC
3. **name** ASC (tiebreaker for same salary)

---

## Example Output

| department_name | name              | salary |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Data Analytics  | James Anderson    | 4000   |
| Data Analytics  | Emma Thompson     | 3800   |
| Data Analytics  | Daniel Rodriguez  | 2230   |
| Data Science    | Noah Johnson      | 6800   |
| Data Science    | William Davis     | 6800   |

**Explanation**:
1. In **Data Analytics**, the top three salaries are 4000 (James Anderson), 3800 (Emma Thompson), and 2230 (Daniel Rodriguez). 
2. In **Data Science**, we have two employees earning 6800: Noah Johnson and William Davis. Both appear, with Noah listed first alphabetically (`Noah Johnson` before `William Davis`).
